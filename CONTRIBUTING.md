# Contributing to Fanoos
Want to make Fanoos better? These are ways you can contribute:

## Ask for new option
Though Fanoos can handle lots of things, you may need other options.
If you want us to add a new option, please have this things in mind:
* Search [previous options requests](https://github.com/IKAcc/Fanoos/search?type=Issues) to see if your wanted option already exists. If it was requested before, +1 it.
* Ask for a single option at a request.
* Make sure that option is global enough.
* Title your new issue Option request: `add: option_name` (e.g., Option request: `add: duration`).

## Report a bug
We can’t claim that Fanoos is bug free. Please be kind and report issues in the following manner:
* Search in existing issues. We don’t want to get hundreds of duplicated reports. There are even chances that we are already working on that issue you’re facing.
* Try to reproduce issue. Make sure that issue is made up by Fanoos and not with your other components with a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/).
* Include an example. We can fix bugs much faster if we could lay an eye upon it.
